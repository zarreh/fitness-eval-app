Based on the fitness assessment results below, draft a starter workout plan for the coach's review and modification.

CLIENT PROFILE:
- Name: {client_name}
- Age: {client_age}
- Gender: {client_gender}
- Goals: {goals}
- Overall fitness level: {overall_level}

ASSESSMENT RESULTS (pre-calculated — do not recalculate):
{results_table}

INTENSITY GUIDANCE based on overall fitness level:
- Excellent / Very Good: moderate-to-high intensity, challenge the client, include progression targets
- Good: moderate intensity, build consistency before adding load or complexity
- Fair: low-to-moderate intensity, prioritize form and habit formation over performance
- Poor: low intensity, emphasize accessibility and small achievable milestones

Draft a weekly workout plan with the following structure:

## Recommended Training Frequency
Suggest days per week and approximate session duration. Scale the recommendation to the client's overall fitness level and goals — a beginner needs recovery time; a fit client can handle more frequency.

## Warm-Up (5-10 min)
A brief, general warm-up routine suitable for this client's age and fitness level. List each exercise on its own line starting with `- `.

## Main Workout
Organized by the client's primary goals: {goals}. Directly address the areas where the assessment showed Fair or Poor ratings. List each exercise on its own line starting with `- `, including sets, reps or duration, and rest periods. Scale intensity to the overall fitness level using the guidance above. If body composition results (BMI or Waist-to-Hip Ratio) were assessed, include exercises that align with those goals.

## Cool-Down & Flexibility (5-10 min)
A brief cool-down and stretching routine. Give extra attention to any flexibility gaps shown in the assessment results. List each stretch on its own line starting with `- `.

## Notes for the Coach
Any specific progressions, scaling options, or watchpoints the coach should be aware of when implementing this plan. If the client has conflicting goals, suggest how the coach might prioritize or periodize them.

Important: This is a draft for the coach's professional review and modification. Do not recommend supplements, medications, or make medical claims.
REMINDER: All list items must be on separate lines starting with `- ` (hyphen space). Never use bullet characters (•) and never place multiple items on the same line.
