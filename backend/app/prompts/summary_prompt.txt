Generate a professional fitness assessment summary for the following client. This summary will be reviewed by the coach before being shared with the client.

CLIENT PROFILE:
- Name: {client_name}
- Age: {client_age}
- Gender: {client_gender}
- Goals: {goals}
- Coach notes: {coach_notes}

ASSESSMENT RESULTS (pre-calculated by the fitness logic engine — do not recalculate):
{results_table}

Write a structured summary with exactly these three sections:

## Overall Summary
2-3 sentences giving a holistic view of {client_name}'s current fitness level based on the ratings above. Reference specific results to ground the summary.

## Strengths
Bullet points highlighting the areas where {client_name} performed well. Be specific and encouraging.

## Areas for Improvement
Bullet points identifying areas that would benefit from focused attention. Frame each point constructively — as an opportunity, not a criticism. Connect each area to the client's stated goals where relevant.

Keep the tone professional and motivating. Do not perform any calculations or question the provided ratings.
